## July: Dumbbell Rows

### Synopsis
Dumbbell rows are an excellent upper body exercise that primarily targets the muscles in the back, including the latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, and trapezius. They also engage the biceps and improve overall upper body strength and stability.

### How to Perform Dumbbell Rows
1. **Starting Position:** Place one knee and one hand on a bench, keeping your back straight and parallel to the ground. Hold a dumbbell in the opposite hand, letting it hang straight down.
2. **Execution:** Pull the dumbbell up towards your hip, keeping your elbow close to your body. Squeeze your shoulder blade at the top of the movement.
3. **Return:** Slowly lower the dumbbell back to the starting position.
4. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions on each side.
