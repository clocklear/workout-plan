## October: Shoulder Press

### Synopsis
The shoulder press is an effective upper body exercise that primarily targets the deltoid muscles in the shoulders. It also engages the triceps and upper chest, helping to build overall upper body strength and stability.

### How to Perform Shoulder Press
1. **Starting Position:** Stand or sit with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a pair of dumbbells at shoulder height with your palms facing forward.
2. **Execution:** Press the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended overhead. Keep your core engaged and avoid arching your back.
3. **Return:** Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
4. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions.
