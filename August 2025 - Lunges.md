## August: Lunges

### Synopsis
Lunges are a fundamental lower body exercise that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. They also engage the core and improve balance, stability, and overall lower body strength.

### How to Perform Lunges
1. **Starting Position:** Stand upright with your feet hip-width apart and hands on your hips or by your sides.
2. **Execution:** Step forward with one leg and lower your hips until both knees are bent at about a 90-degree angle. Your front knee should be directly above your ankle, and your back knee should hover just above the ground.
3. **Return:** Push through your front heel to return to the starting position.
4. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions on each leg.
