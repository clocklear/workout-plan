## November: Dead Bugs

### Synopsis
Dead bugs are an effective core exercise that targets the abdominal muscles while promoting stability and coordination. This exercise is particularly beneficial for maintaining a strong and stable core without putting stress on the lower back.

### How to Perform Dead Bugs
1. **Starting Position:** Lie flat on your back with your arms extended towards the ceiling and your knees bent at a 90-degree angle, with your shins parallel to the floor.
2. **Execution:** Slowly lower your right arm and left leg towards the floor simultaneously, keeping your back flat against the ground. Return to the starting position and repeat on the opposite side.
3. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, counting each side as one rep.
