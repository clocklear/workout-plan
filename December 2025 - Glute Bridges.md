## December: Glute Bridges

### Synopsis
Glute bridges are an excellent lower body exercise that primarily targets the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back. They also engage the core and help improve hip mobility and stability.

### How to Perform Glute Bridges
1. **Starting Position:** Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Place your arms by your sides with palms facing down.
2. **Execution:** Press through your heels to lift your hips off the ground until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement.
3. **Return:** Slowly lower your hips back to the starting position.
4. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions.
