## January: Leg Raises

### Synopsis
Leg raises target the lower abdominal muscles and help build core strength. They also engage the hip flexors and help improve lower body stability.

### How to Perform Leg Raises
1. **Starting Position:** Lie flat on your back with your legs straight and your arms by your sides or under your glutes for support.
2. **Execution:** Keep your legs straight and together, then lift them towards the ceiling until your hips are at about a 90-degree angle.
3. **Return:** Slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position without letting them touch the floor.
4. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions.
