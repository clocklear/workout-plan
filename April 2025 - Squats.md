## April: Squats

### Synopsis
Squats are a fundamental lower body exercise that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. They also engage the core and improve overall lower body strength, stability, and mobility.

### How to Perform Squats
1. **Starting Position:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly turned out. Keep your chest up and your core engaged.
2. **Execution:** Lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back as if you are sitting in a chair. Go down until your thighs are parallel to the ground or as low as you can comfortably go.
3. **Return:** Push through your heels to return to the starting position, straightening your legs.
4. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions.
