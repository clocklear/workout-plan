## June: Mountain Climbers

### Synopsis
Mountain climbers are a dynamic, full-body exercise that increases heart rate and strengthens the core, shoulders, arms, and legs. This exercise also improves cardiovascular endurance and agility.

### How to Perform Mountain Climbers
1. **Starting Position:** Start in a plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders and your body in a straight line from head to heels.
2. **Execution:** Bring one knee towards your chest while keeping the other leg extended. Quickly switch legs, bringing the opposite knee towards your chest while extending the other leg.
3. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, counting each leg movement as one rep.
