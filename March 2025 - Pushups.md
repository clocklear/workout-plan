## March: Push-Ups

### Synopsis
Push-ups are a classic upper body exercise that primarily targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. They also engage the core and improve overall upper body strength and endurance.

### How to Perform Push-Ups
1. **Starting Position:** Start in a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your body in a straight line from head to heels.
2. **Execution:** Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows until your chest nearly touches the floor.
3. **Return:** Push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.
4. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions.
