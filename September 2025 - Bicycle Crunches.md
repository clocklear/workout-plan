## September: Bicycle Crunches

### Synopsis
Bicycle crunches are a powerful exercise for targeting the obliques and the rectus abdominis. This exercise mimics a pedaling motion and provides a great cardiovascular workout while strengthening the core.

### How to Perform Bicycle Crunches
1. **Starting Position:** Lie flat on your back with your hands behind your head and your legs lifted, knees bent at a 90-degree angle.
2. **Execution:** Bring your right elbow towards your left knee while straightening your right leg. Alternate sides in a pedaling motion.
3. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, counting each side as one rep.
